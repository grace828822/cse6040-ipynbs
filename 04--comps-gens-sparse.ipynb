    "In our association mining example, recall that we wanted to maintain a _sparse_ table of the number of occurrences of pairs of items. The focus of today's class is on some Python constructs that will enable us to write compact code to build and maintain such a table, specifically for the problem of mining an email corpus for \"co-occurring correspondents.\"\n",

    "Specific topics in today's notebook are:\n",
    "* [List comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)\n",
    "* [Generators](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/iterators.html)\n",
    "* [Default dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html)\n",
    "* Using the above to build sparse vectors (lists) and sparse matrices (tables) for tabulating item frequencies\n",
